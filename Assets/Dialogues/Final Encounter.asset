    text: It's been a short journey in this foreign world. She hasn't met any humans
      besides the old man. She's had enough of fighting beasts.

      is broken.

    text: I'm not done with you!

    backgroundId: -1
    text: He is unconcious.

    text: Ah. Your are protecting that petty man. The one who lied to you?

    text: The dragon speaks in a reverberating voice, far more imposing than any
      of the guardians.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I don't know what happened, but I still need him to return to my world.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Perhaps I can assist you with that.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I am free thanks to you, after all.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: You don't seem thankful in the slightest to the old man.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Of course not! All men of this world are rotten. And that senile fool,
      he thought he could control me. Me!
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: So? You controlled him instead?
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Interesting! How could you tell?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: First of all, I believe he's been here a year ago. Isn't that when he tried
      to take control of you?
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Indeed. But that does not explain-
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Secondly, that nasty trick with the relics. As old as he is, he probably
      didn't live long enough to see them in action. Last year he could not even
      approach them due to the guardians.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: So he's never seen them before.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Haha! You are smart for a slight human.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Why does everyone see through my mech?! X-rays can't pass through it.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: After all, I was there when you were summoned, remember?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Still doesn't explain it.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: ...
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: What are you going to do now? Still trying to end the world?
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I've had time to think about that. If there are people as interesting as
      you in this world, then I want to see it unfold.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But first, I must make an example of the people who made a fool out of
      me.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Aren't they all dead?
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Most, not all. But alas, their filthy legacy remains.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ugh. Grudges that last generations are the worst.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: What would you know?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: My world has a long history. I've only scraped the surface of it, but I'm
      well versed in war.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Indeed. You want to put an end to it, don't you? But you are powerless
      to resist it, so you go along with it. That's how humans are.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: You go against your own values for some form of compensation, living a
      superficial life. Instead of self accomplishment, you seek wealth and recognition.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But no matter how much you get, it can never quench your thirst. Too weak
      to seek your own happiness, you seek what others have, distracting yourself.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Some die poor, some rich. Regardless, they live a misguided life, one they
      do not truly desire, but can not change. This is why humans can be so evil,
      so greedy, so pitiful.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Heh, sounds a lot my society... I had a tough upbringing. All I wanted
      was to survive, and to protect those around me.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: That is a simple, yet most noble goal.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I naturally ended up in the army. Constantly trying to improve myself,
      I became an ace pilot.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But the more I advanced, the more misguided I got. I was no longer protecting
      people, but hurting them, maintaining a corrupt order.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: It was depressing. So I screwed it all. Screw distopian societies, screw
      corrupt order, manipulation and ads.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ads?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I followd my own values. I went against orders to wipe out a village and
      fought against my own squad instead.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: This is how I became a fugitive, I became part of a resistence that fights
      society to protect people. Eventually, I almost died being chased by an entire
      platoon, and then I got here.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Splendid! I did not think I would get to meet a human like yourself. You
      heart is not much different from a dragon's!
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But we are not the same.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Hmm?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: We might hate the same thing. But I fight to protect people. You fight
      to destroy them out of hatred.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Even the legacy of the people who once defeated you?
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I would not use that word if I were you.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: They fought to protect themselves. And now you are trying to get revenge
      on the their legacy? I will not allow this! I am done running away!
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: A pity. Neither of us will back down.
  - actorId: 4
    backgroundId: -1
    text: ROAAAARRR
