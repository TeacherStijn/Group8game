    text: Welc-
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Who are you?
  - actorId: 5
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Do not worry. You are safe here. My name is Zylstraloniarvynthorianth.
      I am the one who summoned you to the realm or Elyria.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Zylstra-loni-what?? Have you summoned me here to mock me?
  - actorId: 5
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ah, excuse me! You are not used to names from our realm... You can call
      me Wizard. You must be more familliar with that.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ok, Wiz. I'm Alice.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ah, a diminutive. I see Alice has fallen into this old man's charms! Haha!
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: You wish.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Now, how did you summon me? And why?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: '*Ahem* I can tell you are not familiar with magic. It would be difficult
      to explain. All you need to know is that this is a very difficult ritual made
      to summon a champion from another world.'
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Well, I guess you could call me that, but you caught me in a bad condition.
      Might have saved my life, actually.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I am glad to hear that. Otherworldy summon tends to work this way. A hero
      in need of help, summoned to a world in need of a hero.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Hmm. So why do you need me?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: A hundred years ago, our world was in grave danger. A dragon that has lived
      from time immemorial went berserk and wanted to destroy humanity.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: That dragon was defeated right here, in this place. However, a dragon is
      an immortal being. It will eventually come back to life.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: The most powerful mages used all their knowledge to seal the evil dragon
      as best as they could. They created a powerful spell that should have lasted
      forever. But it is falling apart.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: The seal has 5 components. One is this very seal we're standing one. The
      others are four ancient relics, spread across these plains.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: The relics were used to cast the spell, and they can also undo it. We need
      them in order to replace the seal.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But, since the seal was meant to last forever, the relics themselves have
      been guarded by ancient beasts and protected from all life from this realm.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: This is where you need me? Someone from another world who is not affected
      by the seal?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: The relics were used to cast the spell, and they can also undo it. Since
      the seal was meant to last forever, the relics have been protected from all
      life on this continent.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Exactly! Knowledge about the seal has been passed down from legend. But
      the seal on the relics remains a mistery.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Normal humans cannot even enter this area. This is why I have come here
      to summon you, hero. Will you please save us?
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: '*sigh* '
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Fine. I guess that's the least I could do.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: All I have to do is break through the seal and retrieve the relics? What
      will happen after?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: This land's king will want to thank you in person. You will be rewarded
      for your efforts, and become a legend for generations to revere.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: After that, you will be able to return to your world. Or remain here, if
      you so desire.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Sounds fair...
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But why not summon me in the kingdom? Is there nobody else here? One would
      expect a different kind of welcome.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: I am sorry, but it takes a great deal of magical aptitude to even get here.
      No noble or soldier could make it here. I, as the court wizard, have been entrusted
      solely with this task.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Now, let me show you a map of the surroundings.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Is this good enough?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Oh, what sorcery is this? It looks quite different from anything I've seen.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: It's... a hologram.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: ...
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: It's ancient technology in my world.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Truly impressive! Now, the locations are the following...
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: 
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: And be wary of the fiends in these plains. Few humans have crossed here
      in the past century, and the reviving dragon's magic has attracted a lot of
      powerful creatures.
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: But I am sure that you can defeat them, noble hero!
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Me? Won't you be coming as well?
  - actorId: 3
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Ah! I wish! But I am but an old man. My magic is quite potent, but I am
      too slow to keep up with you or with the fiends here. I've only made it here
      by concealing my presence.
  - actorId: 1
    backgroundId: -1
    text: (So much for the old man's charms)
