    text: Paying no mind to the warnings, Alice skillfully flies around a large satelite
      orbiting the planet. As she does so, she turns around and shoots the first
      mech that turns in its path.

    text: Alice is being chased by elite soldiers of Quasarra, the biggest intergalactic
      empire in the universe. All of these soldiers are experts in pursuit and have
      survived countless battles.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: They have suffered colossal casualties chasing after Alice, but this was
      calculated. They have come prepared with a hundred mechs stationed across the
      planned pursuit area.

  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Alice knows. This isn't her first rodeo. She's been part of pursuit operations
      before when fighting for the empire. The plan is always to capture the target
      with 0 casualties.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: This is the second attempt at capturing her, dead or alive. The first time,
      they sent a squad made up from the top 20 pilots they had available.

    text: Hard to believe, but she's managed to blast all of them.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: This time, they've come better prepared. They know that they can't avoid
      casualties, so they're overpowering her with relentless overwhelming numbers.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Chasing all at once is unfeasible. Up to 12 mechs are pursuing her at once,
      while the rest reposition dynamically, ready to intercept.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: If she tries to go down on the surface, the anti-aircraft artillery will
      take her out. If she tries to leave the orbit, she will be inviting her stalkers
      to gun her down.

    text: She's managed to thin the chasers down to 6. That's the lowest so far.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: Her mech won't last much longer in combat, so her best bet is to break
      their formation, destroy the active pursuers and make a run for it outside
      of the planet's orbit.

    text: It was over in a flash. Alice used the decoy flares she was saving up for
      escape, with a hydrogen grenade meddled in. She stabbed the most isolated unit
      and used it as body shield to shoot down the remaining units.
  - actorId: 0
    backgroundId: -1
    text: It may have seemed like a kamikaze attack used as last resort, but for
      Alice, this was a decisive moment. No time for hesitation. It was an improvised
